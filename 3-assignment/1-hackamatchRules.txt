                        |  HACKAMATCH! RULES  |
                        +---------------------+

GENERAL RULES:
--------------
In every hackamatch you will be allowed several guesses to hack the passcode.
The number of guesses you are allowed to make will depend on the difficulty.
The pascode can be made up of digits from 0-9. Not all of these digits may be
used, and repetition is allowed. The length of the passcode, and the range of
the digits they are chosen from will depend on the difficulty chosen. See below.


                    |  EASY  |  MEDIUM  |  HARD  |  EXTREME   
        -----------------------------------------------------
        PASSCODE    |        |          |        |          
        LENGTH      |   4    |    4     |   8    |    10
        ------------|--------|----------|--------|-----------
        DIGITS      |        |          |        |          
        ALLOWED     |  0-3   |   0-7    |  0-9   |    0-9
        IN CODE     |        |          |        |          
        ------------|--------|----------|--------|-----------
        NUMBER OF   |        |          |        |          
        GUESSES     |   10   |    10    |   20   |    20
                    |        |          |        |          

EXAMPLE: In EASY difficulty, the passcode will be 4 digits in length, and can be
made up of the digits 0, 1, 2, and 3. Not all the digits may be used, and
repetition is allowed. A sample passcode could be "1-2-0-0".


DURING THE MATCH:
-----------------
During each turn, you need to input what you think the passcode is ONE AT A TIME
by inputting the first number, then pressing enter, then inputting the second
number, then pressing enter again, and so on. You will be prompted again if you
input an invalid digit.

Once you input your guess, you will then be given feedback on your guess:

“–” means that you have guessed a correct digit but you did not place it in the
    correct position.
“=” means that you have guessed a correct digit and placed it in the correct
    position.”

You may receive several “–” and “=” or none at all, depending on how well you
have guessed the code. 


POINTS CALCULATION:
-------------------
At the end of every match, you will be rewarded with points depending on how
well you did. At every match there is a base number of points which you can
earn. This will vary depending on difficulty. You get 20 bonus points at the end
of every match for every leftover turns which you did not use. You also lose 50
points for every hint that you use.


                |  EASY  |  MEDIUM  |  HARD  |  EXTREME   
        -------------------------------------------------
        BASE    |        |          |        |          
        POINTS  |  200   |   300    |  500   |   1000
                |        |          |        |          


COMMANDS AVAILABLE:
-------------------
There are several commands which you can use throughout the duration of the
match. 

If you get stuck at any point in the game, you may type [HINT] to reveal one
digit of the code. The number of hints you are allowed is 1 less than the length
of the passcode.

If you want to save your game, you may write [SAVE]. 

If you want to forfeit from the current match, you may write [FORFEIT]. This
results in an automatic loss with 0 points earned in your tally.

If you want to exit Hackamon, you may write [EXIT].

Finally, if you ever need to view Hackamon! rules again during the game, just
write [HELP].
