Hackamon is an international hacking competition which attracts the best hackers
in the world–of course, since you’re here, you must be really good! 

You must be pretty excited so let’s get right into the rules:

As a hacker, you will have a hacker level and a hacker class. Since you’re new
you will start as a level 1 hacker, and you will be competing in the Baby class.

There are 5 different classes:

Baby (Levels 1-2)
Novice (Levels 3-6)
Leader (Levels 7-11)
Elite (Levels 12-14)
Champion (Level 15+)

To level up you will need to accumulate a certain number of points.

This varies between levels, and of course, the higher level you are the more
points you need to level up.

How do you get points you say?

That’s simple, you just need to start hacking!

At each hacka-match, your objective is to crack a code consisting of numbers.

You will have a certain number of turns allowed to crack a code, and the length
of code depends on both your hacker level and your chosen difficulty.

At each of your turn, you will be allowed to guess what you think the code is.

After your turn, you will then be notified how many digits from your guess is
1) is the right digit and in the right position and
2) how many is the right digit but in the wrong position.

The hackamatch will end when you run out of turns or once you correctly hack the
code. Depending on how well you solved the code, you will be given points, which
you need to level up.

These rules will be shown to you at the start of your first hackamatch.

Also, I almost forgot! You can change the difficulty of every hackamatch.

Since you’re in the Baby Class, you can only play on easy mode. But once you get
to novice, you can then play easy, medium, hard and custom. At level 15, you
will unlock the extreme difficulty option.

Only by beating this extreme difficulty will you then be granted the “Champion”
class.

But be careful!

Lose 5 hackamatches in a row and you will be automatically demoted 2 levels
down.

However, win 5 hackamatches in a row and you receive a huge points bonus!

That's all from me for now. Good luck!
